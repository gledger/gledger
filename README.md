A toolkit and rest API to interface with a ledger journal file

This project aims to satisfy my usage patterns with ledger.
For example, there are many parts of the journal format that I do not use (like check numbers).
I don't plan on supporting these functions, but if you wish to implement them, feel free to submit a pull request.

This project is in very heavy development!
